# FizzBuzz

* Write a program that accepts an integer >=1 and returns a list of strings
    * For numbers divisible by 3, return “Fizz”
    * For numbers divisible by 5, return “Buzz”
    * For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, return “FizzBuzz”
    * Otherwise, return the number itself as a string

* Run the `FizzBuzzTests` suite to verify your code is working correctly.
